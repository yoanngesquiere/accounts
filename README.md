# Accounts

Small web page to know who needs to pay back who at the end of a trip / after a month of purchases / etc.
with the associated amounts, Accounts is a single page developed with [Riotjs](https://muut.com/riotjs/).

Just add the persons that paid things during a trip / for a party / for the payments of the collocation and so on.
Then add what they paid.

The page will display who need to pay something to someone else.

You can see the page at this [address](http://yoanngesquiere.github.io/accounts/)
